  history: "Bahay Toro, one of the oldest barangays in Quezon City, was historically a grazing area for carabaos, or local water buffaloes, dating back to the Katipunan days. The name \"Bahay Toro\" means \"Carabao House\", reflecting its past as a place where these farm animals were commonly found roaming. Bahay Toro played a significant role in Philippine history. During the Spanish colonial period, it was known as a gathering place for the Katipuneros, the members of the revolutionary society that fought for independence from Spain. The area is also believed to be the site of the Cry of Pugad Lawin, where Andres Bonifacio and other revolutionaries tore their cedulas (residence certificates) in defiance of Spanish rule, marking the beginning of the Philippine Revolution. Today, Bahay Toro remains a vibrant community within Quezon City, encompassing parts of Project 8, Congressional Avenue, and areas near Pagasa.",
